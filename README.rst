An SMTP gateway for Apprise notifications.


Description
===========

Mailrise is an SMTP server that converts the emails it receives into
`Apprise <https://github.com/caronc/apprise>`_ notifications. By accepting
ordinary email, Mailrise enables Linux servers, Internet of Things devices,
surveillance systems, and outdated software to gain access to the full suite of
60+ notification services supported by Apprise.

Mailrise is the sucessor to
`SMTP Translator <https://github.com/YoRyan/smtp-translator>`_, a previous
project of mine that articulated a similar concept but was designed solely for
Pushover.
